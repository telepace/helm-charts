# Telepace Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge &#x20;

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of Telepace, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. &#x20;

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. &#x20;

## Our Standards &#x20;

Examples of behavior that fosters a positive environment for our community include: &#x20;

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others &#x20;
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences &#x20;
- Providing and gracefully accepting constructive feedback &#x20;
- Taking responsibility for our mistakes and learning from them &#x20;
- Focusing on the best interests of the community as a whole &#x20;

Examples of unacceptable behavior include: &#x20;

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances &#x20;
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks &#x20;
- Public or private harassment &#x20;
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., physical or email address) without explicit permission &#x20;
- Other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting &#x20;

## Enforcement Responsibilities &#x20;

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. &#x20;

Community leaders have the authority to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate. &#x20;

## Scope &#x20;

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and also applies when an individual represents the community in public spaces.  \
&#x20;Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement &#x20;

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at `security@telepace.org`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. &#x20;

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. &#x20;
